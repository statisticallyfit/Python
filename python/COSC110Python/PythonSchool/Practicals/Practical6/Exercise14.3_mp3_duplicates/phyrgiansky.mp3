the moonlight it was dancing on the waves out on the sea ...
The stars of heaven hovered in a shimmering galaxy
And a voice from down the ages, so haunting in its song.
The ancient stones will tell us, our love will make us strong.

The breeze it wrapped around me as I stood there on the shore.
And listened to this voice like I never heard before.
Our battles they may find us,  no choice may ours to be.
But hold the banner proudly, the truth will set us free.
